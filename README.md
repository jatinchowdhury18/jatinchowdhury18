**Jatin Chowdhury is an audio signal processing engineer**

### Things I'm doing:
- Creating audio effects as [Chowdhury-DSP](https://chowdsp.com), including [ChowTapeModel](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/AnalogTapeModel), [BYOD](https://github.com/Chowdhury-DSP/BYOD), and [ChowMatrix](https://github.com/Chowdhury-DSP/ChowMatrix).
- Contributing to the [Surge Synthesizer Team](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io).
- Doing audio signal processing research, and [writing about it](https://jatinchowdhury18.medium.com).
- Doing practical research on virtual analog circuit modelling, particularly [Wave Digital Filters](https://github.com/Chowdhury-DSP/chowdsp_wdf).
- Maintaining [RTNeural](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/RTNeural), a neural network inferencing engine for realtime applications.
- Writing low-level and high-level C++ code.
